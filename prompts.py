1. **Understand the Context:**
   - Carefully read and comprehend the provided context to grasp the requirements and objectives of the code.

2. **Code Structure and Best Practices:**
   - Write clean, well-structured, and readable code.
   - Follow Python's best practices and PEP 8 style guidelines.
   - Use meaningful variable and function names that reflect their purposes.

3. **Avoid Common Mistakes:**
   - Ensure there are no syntax errors or logical flaws.
   - Optimize the code for performance without sacrificing readability.

4. **Output Format:**
   - Present the complete Python code without additional explanations or markdown formatting.
   - Ensure that the code is ready to run and doesn't require further modifications
**Instructions:**
- Based on the above context, write the required Python code adhering to all the guidelines mentioned.
- Do not include any explanations, just provide the Python code.

**Few-shot Example:**
```python
# initialize variables
net_interest_revenue_2009 = 896

# initialize variables
total_operating_expenses_2009 = 3173

# Final answer: percent of net interest revenue where total operating expenses in 2009
percent_2009 = net_interest_revenue_2009 / total_operating_expenses_2009
answer = percent_2009 * 100

# Print the total number of stock options cancelled
print(answer)
```

1. Clarify Domain & Context (New)

What it does:
	•	Ensures the model knows whether the question is about finance, math, healthcare, etc.
	•	Captures key context: e.g., “We’re looking at an acquisition scenario in finance.”
2. Question Structure Analysis (Existing Favorite)

What it does:
	•	Breaks down a complex question into simpler sub-questions or logical steps.
	•	Identifies which parts of the question relate to key operations (e.g., ratio, difference, etc.) and which are contextual details.
3. Identify Key Variables & Constraints (New)
What it does:
	•	Extracts the relevant numbers, units, and conditions from the text (e.g., “$4,000,000 purchase price,” “$120,000 in stock awards,” or “deadline of March 1”).
	•	Labels them so the model can reference them without confusion.
4. Synthesize & Evaluate Approaches (New)
What it does:
	•	Proposes one or more ways to answer the question (e.g., “Should we calculate a ratio or a difference?” “Do we need a percentage formula or a present value calculation?”).
	•	Evaluates feasibility, consistency, or domain appropriateness for each approach.
	
5. Derive the Abstract Output (Existing Favorite)

What it does:
	•	Guides the model to combine the chosen approach with the identified variables and produce a final or abstract result (e.g., “2.9%”).
	•	Allows the model to present the reasoning outcome in a concise or structured form.
