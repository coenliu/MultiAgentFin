1. Clarify Domain & Context (New)

What it does:
	•	Ensures the model knows whether the question is about finance, math, healthcare, etc.
	•	Captures key context: e.g., “We’re looking at an acquisition scenario in finance.”
2. Question Structure Analysis (Existing Favorite)

What it does:
	•	Breaks down a complex question into simpler sub-questions or logical steps.
	•	Identifies which parts of the question relate to key operations (e.g., ratio, difference, etc.) and which are contextual details.
3. Identify Key Variables & Constraints (New)

What it does:
	•	Extracts the relevant numbers, units, and conditions from the text (e.g., “$4,000,000 purchase price,” “$120,000 in stock awards,” or “deadline of March 1”).
	•	Labels them so the model can reference them without confusion.
4. Synthesize & Evaluate Approaches (New)

What it does:
	•	Proposes one or more ways to answer the question (e.g., “Should we calculate a ratio or a difference?” “Do we need a percentage formula or a present value calculation?”).
	•	Evaluates feasibility, consistency, or domain appropriateness for each approach.
	
5. Derive the Abstract Output (Existing Favorite)

What it does:
	•	Guides the model to combine the chosen approach with the identified variables and produce a final or abstract result (e.g., “2.9%”).
	•	Allows the model to present the reasoning outcome in a concise or structured form.
